The player lands on the trunk of a massive tree in the Canopy.

The canopy level is sparse and weirdly shaped, with holes the player cannot traverse. Below is the Mire which is flat, yet dangerous.

- The player must cross thin branches to proceed to another area.

Scenarios: Mire
- The player finds some bizarre biolumanescent organisms floating on the water.
- The player is dragged under.
