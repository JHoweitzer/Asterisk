EPIC: Develop a rudimentary text-based adventure game in a sci-fi setting.

Sprint Backlog:
- Develop systems to handle movement around a planetary map, as well as branching tree structures for individual areas
- Develop a system which prints "memories" to files, and can re-read them to the player in dream sequences
- Identify the player's goals in an abstract, long-term sense.
- Write locations and scenarios for a Swamp Planet
