Planet is a dying creature. Energy being moved to the core (brain / heart). Outside is near-dead / dead. Exposed bone / teeth. Craters for eyes.
Sentient population (like antibodies) defends the planet from intruders, as the planet is their energy source and home.
	- Huts burrowed into bone.
	- Forced to move inward
Meet the brain = Flood self with memories (LITERALLY). Millions of years.
	- Twist: the sentient population is meant to leave, start anew.
