Your pod rattles and groans as it pierces the icy-blue atmosphere.
Golden heat flickers around the thick glass windows. You grip your harness.
Through the glowing glass a green horizon stretches before you, long and dark 
like a beer bottle; though you can't ever remember having had beer yourself.

Your stomach lurches as engines kick in to slow your descent. Clumsily, you 
break through the canopy, greeted by snappings and rumblings of foliage outside.
The natural light that once filled your ship dims, leaving just the gentle glow
of your ship's display unit. 

Your ship slows to a hover over a thick round branch of a colossal tree, 
and awkwardly drop to the surface with a loud thunk. The dull hum of your ship
slowly silences.

You unclasp your harness and tap the wide rectangular screen on your wrist.
It begins to glow orange, your only companion in this universe stirs awake slowly.

"LOOKIN GOOD! Where are we? OH! This planet is NEAT! You'll be able to breathe the atmosphere 
no problem. Well. Unless you're worried about bacteria in the air. Your immune system kinda 
sucks; you know that? Should've played outside more as a kid. Keep your helmet on to be safe. 
OH ALSO! The surface of this planet is a nightmare. Dark. Wet. Try to stay out of it ok? I mean 
I'm not the boss of you HAHA. Unless? NAH I'm just kiddin. But really listen to me. Don't forget 
your Blaster!"

You've missed DALE. You grab your Blaster, adjust your helmet, and crank the door handle. The 
outside atmosphere rushes in, and you push the door wide and step onto the firm grey surface of a 
tree trunk.

The landing site. You and your ship rest atop a massive grey tree branch, roughly 30 meters in 
diameter. The air is thick, heavy and still. The light is dim, filtered green by the layers of 
foliage above. Looking up, you can see cracks in the canopy where warm light pours in.  
Below you, a spiderweb of branches.

To your south you see the trunk of the tree, it looms above, even from such a great distance.
The bough below you twists eastward, where it slopes gently downward toward dark still waters
below.

You tread gently along the bough and approach the trunk. The trunk looms above, a colossal 
spire that splits and stretches green across the sky. Like a prop holding up a tent of leaves.
You feel humbled, and take a moment to admire the age of this creature. Cold and still for 
thousands of years.

You place one hand on the grey, cracked bark. For a moment, you feel everlasting. You remove 
your hand and return to your small, fragile reality.

To the west is another massive branch, but perhaps this stoic goliath has secrets to share...
"""
c11Expl = """
You step back a few steps from the trunk and peer upward. You notice a peculiar grey-brown
bulge on the side of the trunk, roughly 10 meters above you. Looking to your left, you notice 
a bright green beetle, half as large as your pod, marching along an adjacent branch. Finally,
you notice some peculiarities in the pattern of the bark to your right.
"""
c11BranchDesc = """
You take a deep breath, then leap to the thinner branch. You stumble a bit with the landing, but 
grab a nearby twig to keep your balance. You wheel around where the beetle trots away, twisting
around the thin limb like a corkscrew.
"""
c22Desc = """
Traveling east, the bough twists and sinks into darkness. Following your shoulder- mounted 
lamp, you tread gently across knots, cracks, and errant twigs. Slowly, the bough 
narrows and bends beneath your weight. You squat to maintain your balance.
"""
c22Expl = """
Crouched on the edge of the branch, you listen gently to the humming of life below you.
Looking below, clouds of insects scatter and part in the white light. Slick black water shines
back. You estimate it's around a 10-meter drop, though it's hard to gauge the water's
depth.
"""
c22Drop = """
You slowly stand, steadying yourself on the quivering branch. "You sure about this bud?" Dale 
chirps.

You close your eyes, take a breath, then step off. You tuck your arms and legs in, and with a 
soft splash you plunge into the cold, still murk. You hit the mud beneath the water hard, and 
you feel yourself get lodged. You open your eyes to the chunky brown water around you. 

Murk.
"""
c22Drop2 = """
You spread your arms out, establish your footing, then pull yourself above the surface. The water
ended up only being chest-deep. The various buzzing, humming, and sloshing of the planet's ambience 
returns. With one hand you wipe off your glass visor, then Dale's screen.

"2.5/10. Poor form, no flips." Dale's screen flashes. Good one bud.

Though the foliage near you is sparse, in the distance your shoulder-lamp reflects against large roots
jutting from the water, a perfect place to sit and get your bearings.

You wade towards thick roots through cold, chest-deep water. Your steps are heavy - the mud 
below tugs against every step you take, as if the planet itself wants to keep you. Periodically, 
you feel slick tendrils brush your legs and chest - hopefully harmless plant matter drifting 
beneath the surface. You trudge towards the thick roots and heave yourself on them - though 
they're too slick and steep to climb, it's a stable-enough spot to sit on for a brief moment.
