Your pod rattles and groans as it pierces the icy-blue atmosphere.
Golden heat flickers around the thick glass windows. You grip your harness.
Through the glowing glass a green horizon stretches before you, long and dark 
like a beer bottle; though you can't ever remember having had beer yourself.

Your stomach lurches as engines kick in to slow your descent. Clumsily, you 
break through the canopy, greeted by snappings and rumblings of foliage outside.
The natural light that once filled your ship dims, leaving just the gentle glow
of your ship's display unit. 

Your ship slows to a hover over a thick round branch of a colossal tree, 
and awkwardly drop to the surface with a loud thunk. The dull hum of your ship
slowly silences.

You unclasp your harness and tap the wide rectangular screen on your wrist.
It begins to glow orange, your only companion in this universe stirs awake slowly.

"LOOKIN GOOD! Where are we? OH! This planet is NEAT! You'll be able to breathe the
atmosphere no problem. Well. Unless you're worried about bacteria in the air. Your
immune system kinda sucks; you know that? Should've played outside more as a kid. 
Keep your helmet on to be safe. OH ALSO! The surface of this planet is a nightmare.
Dark. Wet. Try to stay out of it ok? I mean I'm not the boss of you HAHA. Unless?
NAH I'm just kiddin. But really listen to me. Don't forget your Blaster!"

You've missed DALE. You grab your Blaster, adjust your helmet, and crank the door handle.
The outside atmosphere rushes in, and you push the door wide and step onto the firm grey
surface of a tree trunk.

The landing site. You and your ship rest atop a massive grey tree branch, roughly 30 meters in 
diameter. The air is thick, heavy and still. The light is dim, filtered green by the layers of 
foliage above. Looking up, you can see cracks in the canopy where warm light pours in.  
Below you, there is only darkness.
To your south you see the trunk of the tree, it looms above, even from such a great distance.
The branch below you twists eastward, where it slopes gently downward toward dark still waters
below.
